            <p class="pContent3">"I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." <br>
                That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential<br>semantics and 
                other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result<br>in the determination that "meant 
                to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase<br>as it seems to be, 
                and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. <br>
                But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. <br>
                It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie."

            <p class="pContent4">"There were little things that she simply could not stand.<br>
                The sound of someone tapping their nails on the table.
                A person chewing with their mouth open.<br> 
                Another human imposing themselves into her space.
                She couldn't stand any of these things,<br>
                but none of them compared to the number one thing
                she couldn't stand which topped all of them combined."
